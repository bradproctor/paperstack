# paperstack
#### Note: Work in progress

Simple jQuery plugin that allows you to display a set of containers as if they were a stack of papers.

Supports flipping through "pages" with `next` and `previous` functions, as well as going directly to
a specific page with the `setPage` function.

### To Do
- Work on styling to get it to fit into a container a bit more nicely
- Publish to NPM

### To Run
- Run `npm i`
- Open *index.html*

You can also run `npm start` later on to rebuild.
